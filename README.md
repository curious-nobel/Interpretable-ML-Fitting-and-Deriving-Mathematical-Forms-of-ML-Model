# Interpretable-ML-Fitting-and-Deriving-Mathematical-Forms-of-ML-Model
Interpretable ML is a hands-on project exploring classic machine learning models. Each model is implemented in its own Jupyter notebook with both code and math. The goal is to train models, extract their learned equations, and understand the underlying mathematics.
